## Number of households receiving benefits

Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) is a program by the US Department of Agriculture that provides nutritional assistance to low income households and individuals. In September 2024, more than 22.5 million households received SNAP benefits. The number of households receiving assistance has stayed above 21 million since April 2020, just below the record amount between 2012 and 2014.

## Benefit amounts over time

Current benefits average around \$350 per household and about \$190 per person. Benefit amounts peaked during the more generous COVID relief period in Nov 2022 averaging \$260 per person and \$490 per household.

## Notes

Data was sourced from [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/AMUKJ0). Ten year state and national population data used to calculate the percentage of the population that receives SNAP benefits was obtained from the [USDA](https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17827). There were some irregularities in the data where a large jump or decline (\> 40%) in participation rates in a particular month is followed by a large drop-off or jump (\> 40%) in the next month. In cases where there were such large irregularities between two consecutive months, observations were set to missing. The code for the project is available on [github](https://github.com/mikyasduga/SNAP_data_viz).
