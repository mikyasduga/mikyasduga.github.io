This dashboard allows users to explore individual compensation in nonprofit organizations for executives, board members and other highly compensated positions. The data is sourced from [Form 990 IRS data](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-990-series-downloads) released in 2024. Although this data is publicly available, it's large, unstructured, and requires considerable cleanup.\

Data in this application is limited to the common job titles reported by nonprofits at least fifty times. Individuals who performed their roles as volunteers, those whose compensation was below \$1,000 per year and those who served for only part of the year were excluded.
